This is the IO library for handling events within the 
DSPboard and communication with it. 

This library by-and-large just handles event parsing and unparsing. 

It would be fantastic if this could be used from within python, but
it's really not clear how to get the callbacks working properly

It would be great to have an object that we could pass
events into, that would then fire the relevant signals. 

And similarly, that we could call methods, and it would spit
back the encapsulated event, and be purely functional

AcqDataSource::queryLinkStatus(datasource_t)
AcqDataSource::processLinkStatus(event)
AcqDataSource::EVENT_QUERY

AcqDataSource::setMode(datasource_T, mode); 
mode = AcqDataSource::processMode(event); 

AcqDataSourceControl::setChanGain(datasource_t, chan, gain); 
AcqDataSourceControl::processChanGain(event)


And then there's a SomaDSPCodec object which handles caching state, 
event firing, etc, taking in events and spitting out events
