This is the IO library for handling events within the 
DSPboard and communication with it. 

This library by-and-large just handles event parsing and unparsing. 

Everything here lives in the somadspio namespace. Create
a StateProxy object with a given data source and event target, 
and a timeout. Periodically tell it the time, and pass
in new events for decoding.
