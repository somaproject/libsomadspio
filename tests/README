Here we use some of the common code from the DSP project to create
a little "synthetic" dspboard that will let us test our commands and
verify that the relevant, expected changes do indeed occur. 


we want a general loop that will pass events back and forth: 

1. FauxDSPBoard.getEvents()
2. dspIO.getEvents().
